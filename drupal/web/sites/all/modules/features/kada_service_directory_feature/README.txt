This file describes the feature, from developer to developer. It should focus on why something has been implemented instead of how, but some tricky or special implementations should be mentioned here. Especially if they cannot be documented in code.

== PURPOSE ==
Includes a view customized in code and context for displaying menus.

== CONTEXT ==
- service_directory: Display menus when viewing the directory.

== VIEWS ==
- service_directory: Lists Service descriptions grouped by letter. Synonymes are included in custom code.

== CUSTOM CODE ==
kada_service_directory_feature_feature.module file:
- kada_service_directory_feature_views_pre_execute: Creates a custom query for fetching Service descriptions which have a value in field_alternative_name and creates a UNION with the query generated by Views, so that they will appear as additional rows.
- kada_service_directory_feature_views_post_execute: Alters the results for those rows which have been added in the pre_execute hook, so that Views will render "correctly" matching requirements.

== Changelog ==
* 2015-06-08 *
Changed field_alternative_name cardinality to unlimited. Updated Feeds importers.

* 2015-04-24 *
Synonym listing per Service directory. Some tricky custom code included.
